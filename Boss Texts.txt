Feared by all, the Blood Lich revels in the suffering it causes through suffocation
The Blood Lich's grasp is inescapable, slowly suffocating its enemies with red arrows.
No escape from the Blood Lich's suffocating grasp, a slow and torturous death.
In the grasp of the Blood Lich, enemies suffer a slow and painful suffocation.
Blood Lich Perishes.

You stand no chance against my mastery of the dark arts, for I am the Grandmaster Warlock.
My army of summoned creatures will tear you apart for daring to challenge me.
Your weapon may be strong, but it will not be enough to defeat a Grandmaster Warlock like myself.
You may have defeated other opponents, but you are no match for my mastery of the dark arts.
You may have won battles before, but this is a war you cannot win

You may have courage, but you lack the power to defeat me, the One-Eyed Flying Glaring Overlord.
